welcome to this repo.



Here we have a mini selfbot that you can use for basic stuff in discord.

i call it a mini because it only has a small amount of features compared
to big selfbots like alucard etc.

It has 5 commands but 1 could be very useful, you can leave it open and
you can purge all your messages by typing "beam"

Sadly, discord rate limited this, meaning the speed will not be the same
it will get the job done, but before it would do it at a insane speed.


to setup this selfbot is the very easy. You need to CD in the file or 
open cmd from the file. when you open a cmd from the file you need to
type "pip install -r requirements.txt" and the installation of the req
uired modules will continue.

After that you need to open the python file with notepad, scroll down
till u see tokens ( should be eazy to spot since it has a few blank 
spots below and on top of the line )

put ur discord token and simply run the python file and it should work

enjoy and dont skid :)
